## Description

This was a coding assignment for a job interview I recently completed; this assignment had 4 parts;
 1. fetch and display data from API,
 2. style the fetched data, 
 3. add a text input where users can filter through the list of students by name (full name),
 4. create an expandable list view for each student so their test grades can be viewed.
